Our goal is to analyze US Traffic Accident data and identify the most important elements incurring the traffic accidents. We plan on answering the following questions:

1. What kind of elements affects the probability of accidents most? Natural elements (weather, humidity, etc.) or social elements (distance from convenience store, population density etc.)

2. Is there any advice for individuals and government to prevent traffic accidents?

The full project proposal can be found in "Proposal.pdf"
